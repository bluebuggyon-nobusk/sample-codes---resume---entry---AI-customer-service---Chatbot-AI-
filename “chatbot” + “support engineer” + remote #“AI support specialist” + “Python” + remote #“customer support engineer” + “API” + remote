simple_support_bot.py

A tiny example of a rule-based support chatbot.
Good for an entry-level portfolio:
- shows clean Python functions
- basic text handling
- simple routing based on user intent

# Run: python simple_support_bot.py
# Type messages like:
# hi
# I have a billing question
# I see an error on the screen
# Then try quit to exit.
